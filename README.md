# Brief Introduction

- This is a single-page photo gallery website that allows you to expand and close detailed content by clicking on thumbnails and HD images. I think with a little modification it could become part of a photographer's portfolio website.
- No frameworks and libruaries. Just html, css, and javascript.

> Please click [Interactive Image Gallery](https://qingjieshen.github.io/interactive-image-gallery/) to see the demo.

# Why I'm doing this?

- When I started learning web development, I wanted to know how to create a photo gallery that would open a HD version of a small image when you clicked on it, just like most of the photo gallery websites we see.
- I always felt that there must be some hacking technology to achieve this, but when I learned Event Delegation, I found that this is actually a very simple thing, so I made this website.
- I will regard this as the beginning of accumulation, and I will gradually try to building everything I have ever thought about.

# Key features

- When you click on the image gallery a list page opens showing all the images.
- In the list page, clicking on a thumbnail will open the corresponding HD picture and description
- Click the HD image again will close the preview.
